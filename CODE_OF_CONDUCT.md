# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct document is loosely based on [Ansible's own CoC][ansible-coc].

These policies are not designed to be a comprehensive set of Things You Cannot Do. We ask
that you treat your fellow community members with respect and courtesy, and in general,
Don't Be A Jerk. This Code of Conduct is meant to be followed in spirit as much as in
letter and is not exhaustive.

**Considerate**

Contributions of every kind have far-ranging consequences. Just as your work depends on
the work of others, decisions you make surrounding your contributions to this community  will affect your fellow community members. 
You are strongly encouraged to take those consequences into account while making decisions.

**Patient**

Asynchronous communication can come with its own frustrations, even in the most responsive
of communities. Please remember that our community is largely built on volunteered time,
and that questions, contributions, and requests for support may take some time to receive
a response. Repeated "bumps" or "reminders" in rapid succession are not good displays of
patience. Additionally, it is considered poor manners to ping a specific person with
general questions. Pose your question to the community as a whole, and wait patiently for
a response.

**Respectful**

Every community inevitably has disagreements, but remember that it is
possible to disagree respectfully and courteously. Disagreements are never an excuse for
rudeness, hostility, threatening behavior, abuse (verbal or physical), or personal attacks.

**Kind**

Everyone should feel welcome in this community, regardless of their background.
Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. Do not make or
post offensive comments related to skill level, gender, gender identity or expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
Sexualized images or imagery, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression,
stalking, sustained disruption of activities, publishing the personal information of
others without explicit permission to do so, unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention are all strictly prohibited.  Additionally, you are encouraged not to
make assumptions about the background or identity of your fellow community members.

**Helpful**

This community is committed to being a welcoming environment for all users,
regardless of skill level. We were all beginners once upon a time, and our community
cannot grow without an environment where new users feel safe and comfortable asking questions.
It can become frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community
members are expected to remain courteous and helpful to all users equally, regardless of
skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing responses that prioritize snideness and snark over
useful information.

Anti-harassment policy
======================

Harassment includes (but is not limited to) all of the following behaviors:

- Offensive comments related to gender (including gender expression and identity), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion
- Derogatory terminology including words commonly known to be slurs
- Posting sexualized images or imagery in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking
- Posting others' personal information without explicit permission
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

In addition to the behaviors outlined above, continuing to behave a certain way after you
have been asked to stop also constitutes harassment, even if that behavior is not
specifically outlined in this policy. It is considerate and respectful to stop doing
something after you have been asked to stop, and all community members are expected to
comply with such requests immediately.

Policy violations
=================

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community managers may take any action
they deem appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to warning the
offender, including expelling the offender from participation.

Community managers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment.

We expect all members of this community to follow these policies at all times.
